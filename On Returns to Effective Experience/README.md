# On Returns to Effective Experience

Attached the replication files for the paper 'On Returns to Effective Experience' which is joint work with Sekyu Choi and Benjamin Villena-Roldan.

Abstract: In this paper we study the process of human capital accumulation on the job. This has
important implications for life-cycle inequality and cross-country differences in earnings. Using
a novel dataset from Chile we document a significant gap in wage growth measured using job
ad information versus the one observed in surveys of workers. We develop a lifecycle structural
model where workers face frictional labour markets, uncertainty with respect to match quality
with firms and uncertainty about human capital accumulation on the job. We quantify how
much of the gap in job ad wage growth vs workersâ€™ survey wage growth is due to job market
frictions (time not working) versus learning frictions. We find that failure to learn is the main
reason behind the gap.
