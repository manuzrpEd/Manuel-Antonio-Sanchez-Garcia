# Lifetime Earnings Inequality and Marginal Employment in Germany

Attached the replication files for the paper 'Lifetime Earnings Inequality and Marginal Employment in Germany'.

Abstract: I estimate an earnings and job mobility model before and after the Hartz reforms in
Germany. After the Hartz reforms, full-time work fell and part-time, marginal employment
and concurrent employment rose. Wage inequality increases at the bottom of the
distribution. This comes as a result of lower full-time wages for males and the rise of
part-time work. With the empirical model I then simulate employment and earnings
trajectories and obtain lifetime values of earnings. This estimation shows that there is an
increase in the inequality of lifetime values stemming at the bottom of the distribution.
Generally, both lower wages and a larger hazard of falling and remaining in part-time
employment explain the lower lifetime earnings. However, for males, lower wages has
twice the impact in the decrease of earnings than the new employment transitions after
the Hartz reforms.
