abstract="To gauge inequality in living standards, the distribution of lifetime income is likely to be more relevant than the distribution of current income. Yet, empirical studies of income inequality are typically based on observations of income for one or a few years. In this paper, we exploit a unique data set with nearly career-long income histories to assess the role of so-called life-cycle bias in empirical analysis of income inequality that uses current income variables as proxies for lifetime income. We find evidence of substantial life-cycle bias in estimates of inequality based on current income. One implication is that cross-sectional estimates of income inequality are likely to be sensitive to the age composition of the sample. A decomposition of the life-cycle bias into income mobility and heterogeneous profiles reveal the importance of two explanations that have been put forth to explain the disagreement between current and lifetime inequality.",

 abstract = {As robots and other computer-assisted technologies take over tasks previously performed by labor, there is increasing concern about the future of jobs and wages. We analyze the effect of the increase in industrial robot usage between 1990 and 2007 on US local labor markets. Using a model in which robots compete against human labor in the production of different tasks, we show that robots may reduce employment and wages, and that the local labor market effects of robots can be estimated by regressing the change in employment and wages on the exposure to robots in each local labor market—defined from the national penetration of robots into each industry and the local distribution of employment across industries. Using this approach, we estimate large and robust negative effects of robots on employment and wages across commuting zones. We bolster this evidence by showing that the commuting zones most exposed to robots in the post-1990 era do not exhibit any differential trends before 1990. The impact of robots is distinct from the impact of imports from China and Mexico, the decline of routine jobs, offshoring, other types of IT capital, and the total capital stock (in fact, exposure to robots is only weakly correlated with these other variables). According to our estimates, one more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment to population ratio by about 0.18-0.34 percentage points and wages by 0.25-0.5 percent. },

	They argue that the crowding out effect depends on the type of public
	goods produced (if it is a pure collective good such as justice or
	in areas where private production is possible) and the pay of the
	public jobs. In their model they also mention all the channels: wage,

abstract = {"20 Jahre nach der Deutschen Einheit haben sich die Lebensverhältnisse und die wirtschaftliche Grundlage Ostdeutschlands in vielen Bereichen denen Westdeutschlands angenähert. Angesichts dieses Jahrestages und vor dem Hintergrund der sich im Herbst 2008 verschärfenden globalen Finanzkrise analyisiert der vorliegende Forschungsbericht mit den Daten des IAB-Betriebspanels den deutschen Arbeitsmarkt aus betrieblicher Perspektive in einem Ost-West-Vergleich. Wie ist der Stand des innerdeutschen Angleichungsprozesses zu bewerten? Wie hat sich die globale Finanzkrise auf die deutsche Wirtschaft ausgewirkt? Das IAB-Betriebspanel zeigt, dass zwischen West- und Ostdeutschland strukturelle Unterschiede bestehen, die sich negativ auf die Produktivität Ostdeutschlands auswirken (z.B. relativ kleiner industrieller Sektor, wenige Großbetriebe, weniger wissensintensive Unternehmensdienstleistungen, geringere Exportorientierung, weniger Beschäftigte in hochproduktiven Betrieben). Beschäftigung wurde in Ostdeutschland erstmals seit der Deutschen Einheit in den Jahren seit 2005 aufgebaut. Im Krisenjahr 2009 ist der Umfang der Gesamtbeschäftigung gestiegen (in Westdeutschland konstant geblieben) und der der sozialversicherungspflichtigen Beschäftigung konstant geblieben (in Westdeutschland gesunken). Die geringere Anbindung Ostdeutschlands an Exportmärkte und die bislang als unvorteilhaft bewertete Branchen- und Betriebsgrößenklassenstrukturen haben sich in der Phase des konjunkturellen Einbruchs 2009 offenkundig als Wettbewerbsvorteil erwiesen. Atypische Beschäftigung wie Teilzeitarbeit, geringfügige oder befristete Beschäftigung und Leiharbeit nahm in den letzten Jahren an Bedeutung zu. Vor allem der Bedeutungszuwachs von befristeten Beschäftigungsverhältnissen ist auffallend. Der Anteil der befristeten Beschäftigungsverhältnisse an den Gesamtbeschäftigten etwa hat sich seit 1996 fast verdoppelt. Betriebe begründen die Nutzung dieser Beschäftigungsform vor allem mit dem zeitlich begrenzten Bedarf sowie mit den Flexibilitätsargumenten wie verlängerte Probezeit oder unsichere wirtschaftliche Entwicklung. Im Krisenjahr 2009 wurde Kurzarbeit deutlich häufiger in Anspruch genommen als im wirtschaftlich vergleichbaren Jahr 2003. Vor allem Großbetriebe und Betriebe aus dem Verarbeitenden Gewerbe gehörten zu dieser Gruppe. Anteilig waren 2009 auch viermal so viele Beschäftigte von Kurzarbeit betroffen wie sechs Jahre zuvor. Die Qualifizierung von Kurzarbeitern wurde relativ selten durchgeführt. Die Anzahl ausbildungsberechtiger und tatsächlich ausbildender Betriebe ist in Ostdeutschland geringer als in Westdeutschland. Die Ausbildungsquote (Anzahl Auszubildender im Verhältnis zur Anzahl der Beschäftigten) ist in beiden Regionen Deutschlands aber nahezu identisch; allerdings wird in Ostdeutschland ein erheblicher Teil von außerbetrieblichen Einrichtungen getragen. Das führt dazu, dass die Übernahme- und Beschäftigungschancen von Ausbildungsabsolventen in Ostdeutschland geringer sind als in Westdeutschland. Umgekehrt weist Ostdeutschland eine höhere Weiterbildungsquote auf." (Autorenreferat)"Some 20 years after German reunification, living conditions and the economic base in East Germany are approaching that of West Germany in many areas. In view of this anniversary and against the backdrop of the global financial crisis that intensified in autumn 2008, this research report uses the data from the IAB-Betriebspanel (IAB-Establishment Panel) to analyse the German labour market from an perspective of firms/establishments in an east-west comparison. How can the status of the intra-German harmonisation process be evaluated? How has the global financial crisis affected the German economy? The IAB-Betriebspanel (IAB Establishment Panel) shows that there are structural differences between East and West Germany which adversely impact East German productivity (e.g. relatively smaller industrial sector, fewer large establishments, less knowledge-intensive business services, lower export orientation, fewer employees in high-production operations). Employment increased in East Germany from 2005 onwards for the first time since German reunification. During the crisis year of 2009, the level of total employment increased (remaining constant in West Germany) and employment subject to social insurance contributions stayed constant (falling in West Germany). East Germany's fewer links to export markets and its sector and establishment size class structures that have until now been rated unfavourably have clearly proven a competitive advantage in the economic slump of 2009. Atypical employment such as part-time work, marginal employment or employment on fixed-term contracts and temporary agency work gained in importance in recent years. The increase in significance of employment on fixed-term contracts in particular is remarkable. The ratio of short-term employment contracts to the total number of employed has almost doubled since 1996. Establishments are justifying their use of this form of employment citing mainly short-term requirements and flexibility arguments such as extended probationary periods or uncertain economic development. In the crisis year of 2009, there was much more short-time working than in the economically comparable year of 2003. This group included in particular large establishments and companies in the manufacturing industry. In 2009, pro rat four times as many employees were affected by short-time working than six years earlier. Short-time workers were rarely given training. There are fewer establishments entitled to offer vocational training and actual training operations in East Germany than there are in the West. The training ratio (number of trainees in proportion to the number of employees), however, is almost identical in Germany's two regions, though in East Germany a considerable number is handled by off-site facilities. As a result, the chance of newly qualified trainees being offered employment is lower in East Germany than it is in the West. Conversely, East Germany has a higher advanced training ratio."

abstract = { In this paper, we document whether and how much the equalizing force of earnings mobility has changed in France in the 1990's. For this purpose, we use a representative three-year panel, the French Labour Force Survey. We develop a model of earnings dynamics that combines a flexible specification of marginal earnings distributions (to fit the large cross-sectional dimension of the data) with a tight parametric representation of the dynamics (adapted to the short time-series dimension). Log earnings are modelled as the sum of a deterministic component, an individual fixed effect and a transitory component which is assumed first-order Markov. The transition probability of the transitory component is modelled as a one-parameter Plackett copula. We estimate this model using a sequential expectation-maximization algorithm.We exploit the estimated model to study employment/earnings inequality in France over the 1990-2002 period. We show that, in phase with business-cycle fluctuations (a recession in 1993 and two peaks in 1990 and 2000), earnings mobility decreases when cross-section inequality and unemployment risk increase. We simulate individual earnings trajectories and compute present values of lifetime earnings for various horizons. Inequality presents a hump-shaped evolution over the period, with a 9\% increase between 1990 and 1995 and a decrease afterwards. Accounting for unemployment yields an increase of 11\%. Moreover, this increase is persistent, as it translates into a 12\% increase in the variance of log present values. The ratio of inequality in present values to inequality in one-year earnings, a natural measure of immobility or of the persistence of inequality, remains remarkably constant over the business cycle.

abstract = {We compare earnings inequality and mobility across the U.S., Canada, France, Germany and the U.K. during the late 1990s. A flexible model of earnings dynamics that isolates positional mobility within a stable earnings distribution is estimated. Earnings trajectories are then simulated, and lifetime annuity value distributions are constructed. Earnings mobility and employment risk are found to be positively correlated with base-year inequality. Taken together they produce more equalization in countries with high cross-section inequality such that the countries in our sample have more similar lifetime inequality levels than crosssectionmeasures suggest.},

The reference point of our analysis is provided by an empirical model of both total hours worked and employment. We conduct dynamic simulations of the crisis period to assess how surprising the reaction of the labour market really was. We argue that the most important precondition for the minor reaction of employment during this crisis was the pronounced wage moderation observed in the years before, which constitutes a distinct difference to all other recessions in Germany. Beyond that, the flexibility of adjusting working time, which has increased considerably during the past ten years, facilitated a tendency to labour hoarding. In contrast, short-time work plays a minor role in explaining the difference from previous recessions, since this instrument has always been available to firms in Germany and its use has not been extraordinary compared with earlier recessions.},

Employers’ reticence to hire in the preceding expansion, associated in part with a lack of confidence it would last, contributed to an employment shortfall equivalent to 40 percent of the missing employment decline in the recession. Another 20 percent may be explained by wage moderation. A third important element was the widespread adoption of working time accounts, which permit employers to avoid overtime pay if hours per worker average to standard hours over a window of time. We find that this provided disincentives for employers to lay off workers in the downturn. Although the overall cuts in hours per worker were consistent with the severity of the Great Recession, reduction of working time account balances substituted for traditional government-sponsored short-time work.},

The intention is to keep unemployed job seekers attached to the labour market and to increase their job-finding probabilities. To analyze the unemployment dynamics of job seekers with and without marginal employment, we consider an inflow sample into unemployment and estimate multivariate duration models. While we do not find any significant impact on the job finding probability in a model with homogeneous effects, models allowing for time-varying coefficients indicate a decreased job finding probability of marginal employment at the beginning of the unemployment spell and an increased job finding probability for the long-term unemployed. Our results suggest that job seekers with marginal employment find more stable post-unemployment jobs, and we find some evidence that the relationship between marginal employment and wages and employment stability varies with respect to skill levels, sector and labor market tightness.

Unemployment fell because the Hartz IV reform induced a large fraction of the long-term unemployed to deregister as jobseekers and appear as non-participants. Yet, labour force participation increased because many unregistered-unemployed workers ended up accepting low-paid part-time work that was offered in quantity in absence of a universal minimum wage. A large part of the rise in part-time work was also due to the tax benefits Hartz II introduced to take up a mini-job as secondary employment. This has provided an easy way to top-up labour income staggering under the pressure of wage moderation. The rise in part-time work led to an increase in inequality at the lower end of income distribution. Overall we find that Germany increased welfare as unemployment fell.},

abstract = {In a context of widespread concern about budget deficits, it is important to assess whether public sector pay is in line with the private sector. Our paper proposes an estimation of differences in lifetime values of employment between public and private sectors for five European countries. We use data from the European Community Household Panel over the period 1994-2001 for Germany, the Netherlands, France, Italy and Spain. We look at lifetime values instead of wage levels because, as we show in our results, differences in earnings mobility, earnings volatility and job loss risk across sectors occur in many instances and these will matter to forward-looking individuals. When aggregated into a measure of lifetime value of employment in either sector, these differences yield estimates of the lifetime premium in the public sector for these five countries. We also present differences in the institutional and labour market structures in these countries and find that countries for which we estimate a positive lifetime premium in the public sector, i.e. France and Spain, are also the countries where access to the public sector requires costly entry procedures. This paper is to the best of our knowledge the first to use this dynamic approach applied to Europe, which we are able to do with a common dataset, time-period and model.},

	of flow transition rates for the UK over the last 35 years, we decompose
	unemployment variation into parts accounted for by changes in rates

	to two-thirds of the volatility of unemployment in the UK over this
	period can be traced to rises in rates of job loss that accompany
	recessions. The share of this inflow contribution has been broadly
	the same in each of the past three recessions. Decreased job-finding
	rates account for around one-quarter of unemployment cyclicality
	and the remaining variation can be attributed to flows via non-participation.
	Digging deeper into the structure of unemployment by gender, age,
	and education, the flow approach is shown to provide a richer understanding

	whether they search on the job and, if so, why. The author finds
	that workers search on the job for very different reasons, which
	lead to different outcomes in both mobility and wage growth. A nontrivial
	fraction of workers engage in on-the-job search due to a fear of
	losing their job. This group mimics many known features of unemployed
	workers, such as wage losses upon finding a job. Workers also search
	on the job because they are unsatisfied. This group is roughly equally
	split into those who are unsatisfied with pay and those who are unsatisfied
	with other aspects of their job. Distinguishing these two groups
	allows the author to highlight the importance of the nonpecuniary
	value of a job. He further shows that the evidence that firms make
	a counteroffer in response to a worker's outside offer is scarce
	and that wage outcomes at the time of job-to-job transitions are
	closely linked to the worker's outside option. The evidence in this
	paper contributes not only to deepening our understanding of labor

Using Labour Force Survey data, I examine the size and cyclicality of the flows and transition probabilities between employment, unemployment and inactivity, from several angles. I examine aggregate conditional transition probabilities, job-to-job flows, employment separations by reason, flows between inactivity and the labour force and flows by education. I decompose contributions of job-finding and job-separation rates to fluctuations in the unemployment rate. Over the past cycle, the job-separation rate has been as relevant as the job-finding rate.},

abstract = {Die Ergebnisse der repräsentativen Betriebsbefragung lassen sich wie folgt zusammenfassen: 1. Nach der Länge der Betriebszeiten ist Deutschland im internationalen Vergleich konkurrenzfähig. Dabei entwickeln sich die Betriebszeiten relativ unabhängig von den tariflichen Arbeitszeiten, d.h. die Betriebszeiten haben sich von den individuellen tariflich oder vertraglich vereinbarten Arbeitszeiten zunehmend entkoppelt. 2. Lange Betriebszeiten hängen nicht von langen individuellen Arbeitszeiten ab. Um Produktions- und Nachfrageschwankungen aufzufangen, setzen immer mehr Betriebe unterschiedliche Formen flexibler Arbeitszeiten ein. 3. Flexibilisierung der Arbeitszeit stabilisiert Beschäftigung. So ermöglicht der Einsatz von Arbeitszeitkonten, durch einen produktionsbezogenen Ausgleich von Zeitguthaben und Zeitschulden Beschäftigungsabbau zu verhindern bzw. entgegenzuwirken. 4. Flexibilisierung braucht Regulierung. Arbeitszeitkontenmodelle erfüllen nur dann die Erwartungen der Betriebe und Beschäftigten, wenn die für ein reibungsloses Funktionieren notwendigen Obergrenzen für Zeitschulden und Zeitguthaben sowie die Ausgleichszeiträume definiert und eingehalten werden. Insgesamt sind für drei Viertel der Beschäftigten die Arbeitszeitkonten über Tarifvertrag, Betriebsvereinbarung oder im Rahmen betrieblicher Bündnisse geregelt. 5. 'Regulierte Flexibilisierung' ist beschäftigungsfördernd. In Betrieben, in denen die Arbeitszeit kollektiv geregelt ist, fallen die pro Beschäftigten pro Woche geleisteten bezahlten Überstunden deutlich niedriger aus als in den Betrieben, in denen die Arbeitszeit eher individuell oder informell geregelt ist. 6. Zu dem noch unausgeschöpften Potenzial gehören: Stärkere Verbreitung flexibler Arbeitszeiten in kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen, Verminderung ineffizienter, ungeregelter Flexibilisierung, Abbau bezahlter Überstunden.

	fluctuations during the nineties, while the job finding rate has

  abstract={A new empirical reduced-form model for credit rating transitions is introduced. It is a parametric intensity-based duration model with multiple states and driven by exogenous covariates and latent dynamic factors. The model has a generalized semi-Markov structure designed to accommodate many of the stylized facts of credit rating migrations. Parameter estimation is based on Monte Carlo maximum likelihood methods for which the details are discussed in this paper. A simulation experiment is carried out to show the effectiveness of the estimation procedure. An empirical application is presented for transitions in a 7 grade rating system. The model includes a common dynamic component that can be interpreted as the credit cycle. Asymmetric effects of this cycle across rating grades and additional semi-Markov dynamics are found to be statistically significant. Finally, we investigate whether the common factor model suffices to capture systematic risk in rating transition data by introducing multiple factors in the model. This discussion paper has resulted in a publication in the Journal of Econometrics , 142(1), 399-424.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>},

At the heart of the reform package was the Hartz IV law, which resulted in a significant cut in the unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed. The paper develops a macroeconomic model with search and incomplete markets, calibrates the model economy to German data and institutions, and uses the calibrated model economy to simulate the effects of the Hartz reforms, and in particular Hartz IV, on the German labor market. The paper finds that the Hartz IV reform reduced the noncyclical unemployment rate in Germany by 1.4 percentage points. Employed workers benefited from the Hartz IV reform in welfare terms, but unemployed workers lost. It further finds that the Hartz I–III reforms reduced the noncyclical unemployment rate in Germany by 1.5 percentage points. Finally, the authors’ analysis suggests that the Hartz reforms contributed to the good performance of the German labor market during the Great Recession.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the effects of short-time work (i.e., government subsidized working time reductions) on unemployment and output fluctuations. The central question is whether short-time work saves jobs in recessions. In our baseline scenario the rule based component of short-time work (i.e., due to the existence of the institution) stabilizes unemployment fluctuations by 15\% and output fluctuations by 7\%. Given the small share of short-time work expenses in terms of GDP, the stabilization effects are large compared to other instruments such as the income tax system. By contrast, discretionary short-time work interventions (i.e., rule changes) do not have any statistically significant effect on unemployment. These effects are based on a SVAR estimation,which uses an elasticity of the German establishment panel for identification purposes. The model shows that non-effects of discretionary interventions (i.e., 100\% deadweight) may be due to their low persistence.},

We evaluate and compare their effects on time until job entry, stability of employment, and earnings. Further, we examine the heterogeneity of treatment effects according to the timing of training during unemployment as well as across different subgroups of participants. We find that participating in short-term training reduces the remaining time in unemployment and moderately increases job stability. Long-term training programs initially prolong the remaining time in unemployment, but once the scheduled program end is reached participants exit to employment at a much faster rate than without training. In addition, they benefit from substantially more stable employment spells and higher earnings. Overall, long-term training programs are well effective in supporting the occupational advancement of very heterogeneous groups of participants, including those with generally weak labor market prospects. However, from a fiscal perspective only the low-cost short-term training schemes are cost efficient in the short run.},

  abstract={The existing literature on inequality between private and public sectors focuses on cross-section differences in earnings levels. A more general way of looking at inequality between sectors is to recognize that forward-looking agents will care about income and job mobility too. We show that these are substantially different between the two sectors. Using data from the BHPS, we estimate a model of income and employment dynamics over seven years. We allow for unobserved heterogeneity in the propensity to be unemployed or employed in either job sector and in terms of the income process. We then combine the results into lifetime values of jobs in either sector and carry out a cross-section comparative analysis of these values. We have four main findings. First focusing on cross-sector differences in terms of the income process only, we detect a positive average public premium both in income flows and in the present discounted sum of future income flows. Second, we argue that income inequality is lower but more persistent in the public sector, as most of the observed relative cross-sectional income compression in the public sector is due to a lower variance of the transitory component of income. Third, when taking job mobility into account, the lifetime public premium is essentially zero for workers that we categorize as ``high-employability'' individuals, suggesting that the UK labor market is sufficiently mobile to ensure a rapid allocation of workers into their ``natural'' sector. Fourth, we find some evidence of job queuing for public sector jobs among ``low-employability'' workers.},

	wages). Therefore workers will search more in the public sector reducing
	the probability of filling a vacancy in the private sector so decreasing
	the creation of new jobs. The presence of public sector amplifies

Explicitly, introducing the employment duality present in the Spanish labor market, we study labor market dynamics in a four-state model set-up and we compute the contribution of the different transitions rates to unemployment fluctuations. Our main findings are as follows: i) around 85\% the employmentunemployment gross flows involve temporary contracts; ii) the transition rates involving temporary employment account for around 60\% of the fluctuations in the unemployment rate; iii) almost 80\% of the unemployment rate volatility  explained by movements between unemployment and employment  involves the transition rates to/from temporary jobs.

Our theory sheds new light on how unemployment can affect workers' labor market outcomes and wage determination, providing a rational explanation for discouragement as the consequence of negative search outcomes. In particular, longer unemployment durations are likely to be followed by lower reemployment wages because a worker's beliefs about his job-finding process deteriorate with unemployment duration.

The first part of the empirical work uses a large sample of household heads to examine differences in the unemployment spell distributions of UI recipients and nonrecipients. Sharp increases in the rare of escape from unemployment both through recalls and new job acceptances are apparent for UI recipients around the time when benefits are likely to lapse. The absence of such spikes in the escape rate from unemployment for nonrecipients strongly suggests that the potential duration of UI benefits affects firm recall policies and workers' willingness to start new jobs. The second part of our empirical work uses administrative data to examine the effects of the level and length of UT benefits on the escape rate from unemployment of UI recipients. The results indicate that a one week increase in potential benefit duration increases the average duration of the unemployment spells of UI recipients by 0,16 to 0.20 weeks. The estimates also imply that policies that extend the potential duration of benefits increase the mean duration of unemployment by substantially more than policies with the same predicted impact on the total UI budget that raise the level of benefits while holding potential duration constant.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)<P>(This abstract wa},

  abstract={The German employment miracle with a weak decline in employment and low unemployment during the great recession seems to be a good example for a successful labour market reform. While the aggregate level of job turnover seems to be stable over time, there are nevertheless concerns about rising inequality in the labour market. In this paper we analyze the quality of newly started jobs between 1998 and 2010 using a huge administrative data set which allows to look at job durations and earnings for different groups of workers over time. Microeconometric models of job stability and wages are estimated to control for a wide range of individual, firm and regional characteristics. Our results show a fairly constant level of overall job stability but decreasing wages and rising wage dispersion over time, which is in line with wage moderation explanations of the employment miracle. In a further analysis we focus on certain groups of workers with disadvantages in job duration and wages, like low skilled, formerly unemployed and temporary agency workers. Again, we find evidence of a rise in job durations of new jobs accompanied by a decrease in wages.},

The purpose of this paper is to analyze whether this increase in flexibility has also affected how firms adjust employment in Germany over the business cycle. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses rich microeconomic panel data and fixed effects estimations to compare the employment adjustment of firms with and without WTAs. Findings - The authors show that firms with WTAs show a similar separation and hiring behavior in response to revenue changes as firms without WTAs. One possible explanation is that firms without WTAs used short-time work (STW) to adjust hours worked instead. However, the authors find that firms with WTAs use STW more than firms without WTAs. Originality/value - These findings call into question the popular hypothesis that WTAs were the key driver of the unusually small increase in German unemployment in the Great Recession.},

We estimate a general equilibrium model with a detailed labor market block for post-unification Germany. This allows us to disentangle the role of institutions (short-time work, government spending rules) and shocks (aggregate, labor market, and policy shocks) and to perform counterfactual exercises. We identify positive labor market performance shocks (likely caused by labor market reforms) as the key driver for the “German labor market miracle” during the Great Recession.},

abstract = {I provide theoretical and empirical evidence on the importance of statu- tory incidence in labor markets in the presence of asymmetric frictions. Using a theoretical model I show that labor supply responses are stronger when the statutory incidence of taxes or labor rules falls on firms, even when wages can adjust freely. I explore these mechanisms by studying labor responses to incentives generated by the “Mini-Job” program aimed at increasing labor supply of low-income individuals in Germany. Using administrative data, I show evidence of a strong behavioral response – in the form of sharp bunching – to the mini-job threshold that generates large discontinuous changes both in the marginal tax rates and in the total in- come and payroll tax liability of individuals in Germany. Sharp bunching translates into elasticity estimates that are an order of magnitude larger than has been previously estimated using the bunching approach. To ex- plain the magnitude of the observed response, I show that in addition to tax rates, fringe benefit payments also change at the threshold. Mini-job workers receive smaller yearly bonuses and fewer vacation days but are paid higher gross wages than regular workers. These results indicate that lower fringe benefits make mini-jobs attractive to employers, thus facilitating labor supply responses in accordance with the model’s predictions.},

  abstract={\&quot;This paper aims at analyzing the astonishingly mild response of the German labor market to the severe demand shock that occurred in the aftermath of the financial crisis. It stresses the role of institutions such as working-time accounts which create a large scope for a buffering capacity within the firm. It is argued that labor market reforms and the behavior of social partners have strengthened the adjustment possibilities when facing a temporary slump. The crisis mainly affected export-oriented manufacturing firms in Germany's thriving regions. Before the crisis those firms were the engines of growth and suffered from a shortage of qualified professional workers. Moreover, training costs are relatively high and dismissals would entail a significant loss in firm-specific human capital. Supported by the generous short-time work schemes, these factors contributed to the high willingness of crisis-stricken firms to pursue a strategy of massive labor hoarding. By contrast, the comparatively high employment protection does not seem to play a major role in explaining the adjustment behavior of German firms in the current crisis.\&quot; (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku) ((en))},

  abstract={How do workers and firms respond to comprehensive labor market reforms? We use detailed micro data to analyze the German Hartz Reforms through the lens of a structural model of the labor market. These reforms aimed at reducing unemployment, by increasing working hour flexibility, job matching and work incentives. In our setting, reforms directly affect the model parameters, which are estimated using matched data on 430,000 workers in 340,000 firms. Contrary to previous findings, our analysis shows that, although the reforms shortened the typical duration of unemployment, they did not reduce unemployment as a whole and led to a decline in wages. Low-skilled workers suffered the most in terms of employment and wage losses. Furthermore, we decompose the contribution of each reform wave to employment and wage changes, finding that the reduction in generosity of unemployment benefits was the principle driver in reducing wages.},
